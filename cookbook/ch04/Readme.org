* The sample protocol
In this chapter, we are going to consider three recipes describing how to implement the synchronous
iterative ~TCP~ server, synchronous parallel ~TCP~ server, and asynchronous ~TCP~ server. In all the
recipes, it is assumed that the server communicates with clients using the following intentionally
trivialized (for the sake of clarity) application layer protocol.

A server application accepts request messages represented as ASCII strings containing a sequence of
symbols ending with a new-line ASCII symbol. All the symbols coming after the new-line symbol are
ignored by the server.

Having received a request, the server performs some dummy operations and replies with a constant
message as follows:
    ~"Response\n"~

Such a trivial protocol allows us to concentrate on the implementation of the server and not the
service provided by it.
